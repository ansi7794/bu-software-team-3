Notes: Right now the html file goes to login.js when the form submits. Can make register redirect to html and login page submit the form. If I do that, the loginFunction() can be deleted. OR I can make an onclick function but a lot of parameters will be passed in.


Right now it's configured like the first one. There is no onclick, only a submit, on the login button in login.html.
